The UI text is surrounded by double asterisks. For example, <strong>bold</strong>.</p><p>Italics are rarely used. Text surrounded by single asterisks is rendered in <em>italics</em>.</p><p>Monospace text is used for code examples. Text surrounded by double grave accent characters is rendered in monospace font.</p><p>.. comments can be added in a file by starting a line with 2 periods and a space.</p><p>In English source files, look for comments addressed to translators from writers.</p><p>..

You can add the conditional text as regular text or as a note.</p><p>Make sure to indent the paragraph under the directive.</p><p>.. only:: Partners

 Data about course enrollment is available from edX Insights. You can access
 Insights from the instructor dashboard for your live course: after you select
 **Instructor**, follow the link in the banner at the top of each page. For
 more information, see `Using edX Insights`_.

.. only:: Open_edX

    .. note::
      If you want to require an entrance exam for your course, you also create
      the exam in the course outline. Before you can create an exam, you must
      set your course to require an entrance exam in Studio. For more
      information, see :ref:`Require an Entrance Exam`.
</p><p>To conditionalize more than a paragraph, use either the only:: Partners or the only:: Open_edX directive, and then use an include:: directive indented under the only directive.</p><p>.. only:: Open_edX

   .. include:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/running_course/Section_course_student.rst
</p></p><p><h1>Notes and Warnings</h1><p>.. note::
   This is note text. If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap
   and are indented to the same level as the note tag. If formatting is
   incorrect, part of the note might not render in the HTML output.

   Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent
   to the same level as the rest of the note.
</p><value>Null</value><p>   Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent to    the same level as the rest of the note.</p><p>.. warning::
   Warnings are formatted in the same way as notes. In the same way, lines
   must be broken and indented under the warning tag.
</p><value>Null</value></p><p><h1>Cross-References</h1><p>In edX documents, you can include cross-references to other locations in the same edX document, to locations in other edX documents (such as a cross- reference from a location in the <em>Building and Running an edX Course</em> guide to a location in the <em>EdX Learner's Guide</em>), to JIRA stories, and to external websites. In this section, "EdX documents" refers to the resources, including guides and tutorials, that are listed on docs.edx.org.</p><p>For more information about creating cross-references using RST and Sphinx, see <value>Null</value> in the online Sphinx documentation.</p><p><h1>Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document</h1><p>Cross-references to locations in the same document use anchors that are located above the heading for each topic or section. Anchors can contain numbers, letters, spaces, underscores, and hyphens, but cannot include punctuation. Anchors use the following syntax.</p><p>.. _Anchor Text:
</p><p>The following example shows an anchor for a section, followed by the heading for that section. SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts is the anchor text.</p><p>.. _SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts:

******************************
Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes
******************************
</p><p>To create cross-references to locations in the same document, you can use the anchor only, or you can use your own text. The anchor text is never visible in output. It is replaced by the text of the heading that follows the anchor or the text that you specify.</p><p><h1>Cross-References Using the Anchor Only</h1><p>To add a cross-reference to a specific location in a document and use the text of the heading for that location as link text, use :ref:`Anchor Text` syntax, as in the following example.</p><p>For more information about using keyboard shortcuts, see :ref:`SFD SN
Keyboard Shortcuts`.
</p><p>In this example, "SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts" is the anchor text for a section that is titled "Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes". Readers will see the following text, and "Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes" will be an active link.</p><p>For more information about using keyboard shortcuts, see Keyboard Shortcuts
for Notes.
</p></p><p><h1>Cross-References Using Specified Link Text</h1><p>For internal cross-references that use text other than the heading for the section that you're linking to, use :ref:`specified text&lt;Anchor Text>` syntax, as in the following example.</p><p>If you want to, you can use :ref:`keyboard shortcuts&lt;SFD SN Keyboard
Shortcuts>` to create, edit, and view notes.
</p><value>Null</value><p>  Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the opening   angle bracket for the anchor text.</p><p>In this example, "keyboard shortcuts" is the link text, and "SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts" is the anchor text for a section that is titled "Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes". Readers will see the following text, and "keyboard shortcuts" will be an active link.</p><p>If you want to, you can use keyboard shortcuts to create, edit, and view your
notes.
</p></p></p><p><h1>Cross-References to Locations in Different edX Documents</h1><p>You can create cross-references between different edX documents. For example, you can create a link in <em>Building and Running an edX Course</em> to a topic in the <em>EdX Learner's Guide</em>. To do this, you use the intersphinx map ID of the document that you want to link to and the anchor text for the section you want. The cross-reference uses the following syntax.</p><p>:ref:`intersphinx_map_ID:Anchor Name`
</p><p>For example:</p><p>:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Release Dates`
</p><p>To find the intersphinx map ID for the document that you want, follow these steps.</p><p>#. Open the conf.py file in the <value>Null</value> folder, and then    locate the following line.</p><p>   intersphinx_mapping = {</p><p>#. In the list that follows this line, find the ID for the document that you    want. The text between the single quotation marks (') at the beginning of    each line is the intersphinx map ID for the document.</p><p>The following intersphinx map IDs are the most frequently used.</p><value>Null</value><p>  * - Map ID     - Document   * - partnercoursestaff     - <em>Building and Running an edX Course</em>   * - opencoursestaff     - <em>Building and Running an Open edX Course</em>   * - learners     - <em>EdX Learner's Guide</em>   * - openlearners     - <em>Open edX Learner's Guide</em>   * - data     - <em>EdX Research Guide</em>   * - insights     - <em>Using edX Insights</em>   * - installation     - <em>Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform</em>   * - opendevelopers     - <em>Open edX Developer's Guide</em>   * - partnerreleasenotes     - Partner release notes   * - openreleasenotes     - Open edX release notes</p></p><p><h1>Cross-References to JIRA</h1><p>For cross-references to JIRA tickets, use the :jira:`PROJECT-ticketnumber` syntax, as in the following example.</p><p>For more information, see :jira:`DOC-2316`.
</p><p>Note that jira replaces ref for these links.</p><p>Readers will see the following text, and "DOC-2316" will be an active link.</p><p>For more information, see DOC-2316.</p></p><p><h1>Cross-References to External Web Pages</h1><p>A cross-reference to an external web page has several elements.</p><value>Null</value><value>Null</value><p>To create an external cross-reference, follow these steps.</p><p>#. In the paragraph where you want the cross-reference, add the text that you    want to use for the link, formatted as follows (where "Release Pages" is the    link text). This creates an anchor out of that text.</p><p>   ::</p><p>      The edX engineering wiki <value>Null</value> provide access to detailed       information about every change made to the edx-platform GitHub       repository.</p><p>#. In the file that contains the cross-reference, add an include directive    for the edx-documentation/en_us/links/links.rst file if one does not    already exist. These include directives are typically at the end of the    file.</p><p>   ::</p><p>      .. include:: ../../links/links.rst</p><p>   .. note::</p><p>      The path to the links.rst file depends on the location of the file where       you are creating the link. For example, the path might be       ../../../links/links.rst or ../links/links.rst.</p><p>#. In the edx-documentation/en_us/links/links.rst file, add an entry for    the anchor text and the URL of the external website, formatted as follows.    Make sure that the anchor text in this file matches the anchor text in the    file that contains the cross-reference exactly, including capitalization.</p><p>    ::</p><p>      .. _Release Pages: <value>Null</value></p><p>Readers will see the following text. "Release Pages" will be an active link.</p><p>The edX engineering wiki Release Pages provide access to detailed
